## Assignment Section
### Problem-1
     a. Use the Assignment_dataset-1 to perform Regression
        b. Predict -> 'HeartDisease' 
            1. 'HeartDisease' as dependent variable and all other variables as independent
            2. Every time,Do we need all independent variables for prediction ? 
                Hint :(hit try and error) choose few independent variables and try regression. Compare the test loss with previous.(submit any two combinations)
            3. Explian which regression method is required (Linear or Logistic) to perform this prediction with the help of 'y_test' and 'Prediction' distribution plots.
            
        c. Predict-> 'Cholesterol'
            1. Choose the appropriate regression method to perform the task.
            2. Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualizations
