## Assignment Section

### 1.Problem Regression

a. Use the Assignment_dataset-1 to perform Regression
 
b. Predict -> `HeartDisease` 
 
1. `HeartDisease` as dependent variable and all other variables as independent

2. Every time,Do we need all independent variables for prediction ?

    -`Hint`: (hit try and error) choose few independent variables and try regression. Compare the test loss with previous.(submit any two combinations)

3. Explian which regression method is required (Linear or Logistic) to perform this prediction with the help of `y_test` and `Prediction` distribution plots.
            
 c. Predict-> `Cholesterol`
 
   1. Choose the appropriate regression method to perform the task.
   2. Using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` visualize the data distributions as mentioned explained in the class.

### 2.Problem -Toss a coin N times and plot successive head distribution.

a. write an algorithm to toss a coin (as discussed in the class).

    Note 1 : Assume that coin is fair i.e P(Head)=P(tail)=0.5

    Note 2 : flip the coin N number of times and plot the successive heads distribution. 

    Note 3  : Perform the experiment with N as 50,100,500,1000.

### 3.Problem-Find the `statistics` for the below data 


    Note 1 : create a python lists with the data 
            list1=[5.5,5.6,6.1,6.1,6.0,5.9,5.8,5.8,5.8,9.1]
            list1=[5.5,5.6,6.1,6.1,6.0,200.0,5.8,5.8,5.8,9.1]
            list2=[20.0,1000.0,800.0,910.0,950.0,980.0,990.0,890.0,880.0,93.0]
             
    Note 2 : Comment about the best measure of central tendency for the respective lists.
